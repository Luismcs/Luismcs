At the moment, I'm studying Programming at ATEC. Currently, I am seeking to improve my soft and programming related skills. I consider myself disciplined flexible and able to learn from other people. I'm always looking for oportunities to challenge myself, leave my confort zone, and apply my knowledge.
Skills: C++/HTML/CSS/VitualBox Management
