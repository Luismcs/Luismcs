At the moment, studying Programming at ATEC. Currently, I am seeking to improve my soft and programming related skills. I consider myself disciplined. Although I don't have professional experience, I'm always looking for oportunities to challenge myself and apply my knowledge.

Skills: C++/HTML/CSS/VitualBox Management
